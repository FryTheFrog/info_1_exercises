solutions for the tasks in the course 'Informatics 1' (2021)

-Make sure to have the correct imports:
  -ACCESS needs the module name "public" in addition to the file name. -> e.x. "import public.game_logic" instead of "import game_logic"
  -the files in this repo are instead optimized for local machines
 
-For most exercises I have not implemented additional test cases.

-For all posted tasks the solution should reach max. score
