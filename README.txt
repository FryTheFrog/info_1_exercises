solutions for the tasks in the course 'Informatics 1' (2021)

-Make sure to have the correct imports:
  -ACCESS needs the module name "public" in addition to the file name. -> e.x. "import public.game_logic" instead of "import game_logic"
  -the files in this repo are instead optimized for local machines
 
-For most exercises I have not implemented additional test cases.

-For all posted tasks the solution should reach max. score

-Ex_12, Task 3:
  -the test cases in ACCESS seem to be buggy for the method "WordLogic.word_selection()"
  -the method implented in the Template already reaches max score, but I expect this Task to be reworked
  -as per Tue, 7.12. the posted implementation also reaches max score but I can't confirm that this implementation is correct in the future,
   since the grading gives max score anyway
