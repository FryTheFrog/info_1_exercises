-These are the original exercises from ACCESS
-The 'description.md' files feature the actual exercises
-The 'public' folders include the files needed to do the exercises
    -usually templates are provided
    -sometimes additional resources are also included
-The 'private' folders are not needed
    -they feature the tests that are used to grade submissions in ACCESS
-The 'solution' folders contain the sample solutions

-Imports are optimised for ACCESS in this folder
    -to make them work on your local machine you need to adapt them
