This is my playground for the C language

-Here I'm documenting my journey to learn this sadistic language
-I'm uploading the exercises I'm doing along with my solutions
-most files feature an excessive amount of comments with explanations
-the first exercises will be basic problems to get used to the syntax
-later on I'll tackle the more C specific problems
    -> by that I mean stuff that isn't really a thing in Python
    -> Pointers (what the actual fuck), Memory Allocation etc.

ATTENTION!
-I am NOT a C expert
-the uploaded implementations may contain mistakes
-I may not be following conventions (although I'm trying)
-feel free to correct me (or just tell me that I suck)
